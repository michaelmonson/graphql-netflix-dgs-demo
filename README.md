# graphql-netflix-dgs-demo

A minimal GraphQL demo project built with [Netflix's DGS Framework](https://github.com/Netflix/dgs-framework) and Spring Boot. 
Even though this is very much a starter project, I gave it a solid foundation for showcasing GraphQL with Netflixâ€™s DGS framework.
This demo project serves as a starting point for exploring schema-first GraphQL API development in Java.

## Purpose

This project was created to experiment with:
- GraphQL schema-first design
- Spring Boot integration with DGS
- Basic query and resolver setup
- Clean code structure for scalable GraphQL services

## Tech Stack

- Java 11+
- Spring Boot
- Netflix DGS Framework
- Gradle
